# aspectual_verb_filters
Each folder is dedicated to one aspectual verb and contains three files, for example:

  filter_start.py
  
  results_start.tsv
  
  sample_start.tsv

The .py file contains the filters for this particular verb (in this case, "start"); the "results" file contains all the phrases with this verb downloaded from wikisearch; and the 
"sample" file contains a random sample of 100 phrases that result from application of the filters to the "results" file.
