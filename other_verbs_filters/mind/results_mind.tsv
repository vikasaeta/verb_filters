17149328	bit	mind	6	6	4	4	I do not always mind a bit of rough-and-tumble in the heat of things on Talk pages and in edit summaries , but it ' s a chore to have to defend '' perfectly routine and proper '' behavior -LRB- even if all I really needed to do was point people to the pertinent discussions -RRB- and it ' s a further chore to keep checking in to make sure that I have not , through some quirk , been sanctioned anyhow .
