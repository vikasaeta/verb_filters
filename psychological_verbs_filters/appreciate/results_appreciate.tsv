17803241	concept	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the concept here , but any infobox that is used should be very small or incorporated with another box .
17803242	concern	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the concern about scaring off some new editors , but creating a completely new article is not the sole -LRB- or even the most common -RRB- starting point for an editor , and we want better new editors , rather than keeping standards low to attract more people prone to creating unsourced content .
17803243	concern	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the concern about the quality of content that is being generated , but know yourself , and take breaks when you find you can not maintain the standard of behavior that is expected .

17803247	concern	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the concern but if you read within the article I am not promoting a script or program someone else wrote , just referencing to it so people can compare what I have created to what microsoft has created .

17803273	concern	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the concern that `` Adminisrator ' s Noticeboard '' may scare away non-administrators , which is why I endorse Centrx ' s idea of changing that board ' s name to '' ' Administrative Noticeboard '' ' .

17803275	confidence	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the confidence you have in GA and FA , but all articles have editors whose consensus is reflected in the state of the articles they edit .

17803284	section	appreciate	4	4	1	1	I appreciate the contract section that you and Off2riorob created - it is a good piece - but its level of detail would fit far better at Wikinews -LRB- a website that I love -RRB- and not here on Wikipedia .
17803286	copyediting	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the copyediting -LRB- my prose needs all the help it can get -RRB- and believe I have addressed both of the comments above .

17803296	desire	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the desire to assume good faith , but it is misplaced here - the history is long and very clear .
17803297	desire	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the desire to avoid ugliness and I am very nearly ready to support this article , but there is something about the lead section that is not quite right for me .
17803298	desire	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the desire to clean up entries , but the software is very active an very useful for many people .
17803299	desire	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the desire to get people to `` play by the rules '' , and I have tried in good faith to do so .

17803301	desire	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the desire to promote goodwill , but we should be governed by policy .
17803302	desire	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the desire to properly and conclusively cite sources , but it seems a bit overcrowded and hard to read .

17803583	honesty	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the honesty in the article creator asking for deletion .
17803584	amount	appreciate	4	4	1	1	I appreciate the huge amount of work you put in here , but think that if you ' re granted the tools , you will need to be prepared to expend a little bit of extra time explaining their use sometimes and I worry that you are disinclined to do so .
17803585	humor	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the humor , but dislike propagating the false impression that `` keep '' or `` delete '' constitute '' voting '' .
17803586	humor	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the humor , but if other editors stop participatng , then this will be proven to be a dead horse .
17803587	idea	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the idea behind this distinction , yet , a color is defined only as how something is perceived by human vision .
17803588	idea	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the idea , but blocks such as these on long-standing contributors are drama-magnets .

17803595	importance	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the importance of administrators not being involved when using their authority ; however , there is no doubt that Zeq violated his probation , so an unbiased administrator is as good as a biased one in calling this case - - even a robot would come to the same conclusion - - that Zeq violated his probation .

17803618	insight	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the insight and would like to continue a discussion along these lines , but , I think it would be better served on either the WQA talk page or one of our pages .

17803623	intent	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the intent but it does seem to be OR unless it can be shown that such a thing is referenced outside the context of software .
17803624	intention	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the intention behind this article -LRB- not overloading the main article -RRB- , but its existence does reveal a summary style problem .

17803640	enthusiasm	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate their enthusiasm , but this is a perfect example of when someone should start their own Wiki for a subject they are interested in , not put it in Wikipedia .
17803641	frustration	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate their frustration that they have not taken to this like a duck to water , but if one has been blocked for a specific reason then it repeating that which got them blocked is not going to help .

17803643	input	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate their input and it ' s understandable that patent attorneys from the US would have little understanding of the cultural significance of such an organisation .

17803646	irony	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the irony that a whole slew of voice actors may pass a SNG not by their voice acting career but by singing the opening or ending theme of an anime .
17803647	opinion	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate their opinion and wish them the best luck writing their application software ; but I can not always write such coarse-granularity code .
17803649	willingness	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate their willingness to attempt to salvage stray edits when possible , versus reverting any and everything out-of-hand .

17803675	link	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the link to the Characters page , but they are two different types of articles - Characters in the Halo series makes no OR claims , and was spun off because such details can not go in the video game articles because it would be too large - an exception provided by List of characters .

17803708	need	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the need for more detail regarding the image , but IMO is not currently affecting EV enough to wipe it out ; there is enough information for it to be useful .
17803709	need	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the need for summary style to keep Featured Articles short , but the applications section seems rushed and random .

17803725	concern	appreciate	4	4	1	1	I appreciate the notability concern now , but why did you wish to delete the museum article before that ; you made no indication it was notability .
17803726	notion	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the notion of seeing the Black Panther through the eyes of an Everyman , but the Panther is almost relegated to secondary status in his own book .

17803733	offer	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the offer to crop the picture .
17803734	offer	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the offer to email the abuse address , but while it may be useful for them to know , it does not really address the general problem being tackled from these networks .

17803762	passion	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the passion of Summonmaster13 in defending the article , but his belief the game is `` too sacred '' only points out the POV inherent in its creation .
17803763	effort	appreciate	5	5	1	1	I appreciate the patience and effort of those attempting mediation and mentorship , but it should have been clear long ago that GS either does not understand what is wrong with his behavior , or simply does not want to reform .

17803959	sympathy	appreciate	3	3	1	1	I appreciate the sympathy expressed here for the article ' s creator , but the fact is that many if not most articles that end up here have a `` primary author '' and we do not want to set a precedent that seeming like they worked hard on it is a free pass from being subject to policy .
