13511777	thrust	like	4	4	1	1	I like the general thrust of this , but I ' m not so sure that the Main Page is the right place ; flash mobs of brand new editors are hard to handle , and that ' s what you ' re mostly going to get by advertising like so on the front page , in my experience .

13511803	guy	like	3	3	1	1	I like the guy and have interacted with him well before , but am generally left with an impression of giddiness - not necessarily a bad thing , but probably not what we want in an admin .

13511845	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea , and an picture of a similar setting could be really neat , but especially damning is that the focus is on the tree thereby leaving the arches and sky to look like hell .

13511847	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea and have like many others I am sure a great deal of sympathy for you and your freinds at VirginiaTech as you come to terms with what happened .

13511860	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea as well .
13511861	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea because it gives context for what was happening around the world at that time -LRB- and gives context for what was happening for ongoing events between nations , e .

13511863	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea behind your questions , but I do not think they ' ll accurately capture what people want , mostly because pure `` readers '' tend to not frequent this or other similar fora .

13511865	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea best about trying it out on the numerology article and seeing if it can build up steam to be spun off to its own article .
13511867	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea , but a caveat might be editors deciding a lot more often , and a lot more erroneously , that articles belong in userspace .
13511868	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea , but adding color to the header is not the way to do it .

13511883	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea , but I think the French Oracle is a lot similar to the English reference desks , except that it takes forever to load and that the regulars seem to be called habitu e s , which is much chicer .
13511884	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea , but I think you can add it into wikipedia .
13511885	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea , but it needs to establish a bit more .
13511886	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea but its contradictory as written .
13511887	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea , but it would be pretty tricky to do ; it would be hard technically to keep the highlighting when the page was edited .

13511898	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea , but placing the key out of its keyboard context means its encyclopedic -LRB- rather than philosophical -RRB- value is rather non-existent .

13511900	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea , but the current phrasing is vague - - appears to make breaking any policy an abuse of admin powers .

13511908	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea , but this is not an acceptable article for many reasons including those mentioned above .

13511920	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea in theory , but in practice it seems like it might be unwieldy - an article on foreign-born players for Australia alone encompasses a number of sections and dozens upon dozens of names .

13511947	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea of a DOI bot , but it should not remove a URL just because the URL happens to resolve to the same resource as the DOI .

13512131	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea of listing notable jokes played by other people but it means that genuinely notable events such as the end of the Spanish Civil War or Iran overthrowing the Shah will never feature in On this day .

13512183	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea of pointing to the talkpage tab , which sort of acts a bit like a tutorial , as long as all the notifications are on the users talkpage of course and not some other sort of notification .

13512211	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea of renaming things FOR DISCUSSION rather than FOR DELETION , since Keep is a frequent and legitimate outcome of that process and I have dealt with more than one newcomer to WP who has been thoroughly put off that their undersourced-but-legitimate contribution to the encyclopedia had been prejudged to be unworthy by unseen forces and was slated for doom .
13512212	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea of right-left alternation of photos .

13512214	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea of saving energy , but I ' m not sure if this is just an urban legend .
13512215	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea of , say , someone who does a lot of work in the area of deletion merely having to ask a bureaucrat for a delete button , having amply shown themselves to be trustworthy in that area .

13512218	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea of separating it into historical periods since the criticism of marriage and marriage itself has changed a lot over time .

13512229	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea of tabbed pages for the concerns expressed by Wetman , which involved visual encroachment by infoboxes .
13512230	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea of tagging with BLPPROD , rather than confusing the issue of whether you can remove a PROD tag or not .

13512242	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea of the cumulative list , that is an excellent way to record community dissatisfaction with an admin over time .

13512259	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea of the template and believe that people would soon get used to them -LRB- even if they dislike them now -RRB- , but I think it is better to make the text as small and unobtrusive as possible .

13512261	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea of the USB key , loaded with music and photos you have chosen for her .

13512298	idea	like	3	3	1	1	I like the idea of Wikipedia , it did sound a bit ridiculous that there would be a website that anyone can change when I first found out about it , but I was convinced it was possible and now here I am .

13512351	image	like	3	3	1	1	I like the image a lot , but it needs a much more informative caption .
13512352	image	like	3	3	1	1	I like the image a lot despite the drawback of it being obviously in captivity .
13512353	image	like	3	3	1	1	I like the image and it ' s of good size , and I want to see if it ' s of featured picture quality .
13512354	image	like	3	3	1	1	I like the image and see value in it .

13512363	image	like	3	3	1	1	I like the image but , think we need to wait a bit before this one goes up as we have already had three bridges this year .

13512369	image	like	3	3	1	1	I like the image per nom , but weak because I think the other one that shows this is a peninsula has slightly better EV -LRB- though is not as good a photo -RRB- - this one just clips that end bit of land and captures some random bush at the other side .

13512401	infobox	like	3	3	1	1	I like the infobox , it keeps nasty things like longitude and latitude out of the lead and it provides a quick overview of the city .

13512433	irony	like	3	3	1	1	I like the irony though of an editor doing everything to reinstall sections he feels are necessary , even though they are archived and accessible , but who just as easily changes his three days old posts in discussions , even when people have already responded to them .

13512441	jerkometer	like	3	3	1	1	I like the jerkometer , though it measures average jerk not instantaneous jerk , but with suitable spring constants it would be an excellent instrument for use at the back of a bus .

13512744	skin	like	4	4	1	1	I like the new skin but this is just a minor annoyance if you use a long edit summary -LRB- as you have to use show preview to be able to see all of what you have typed without having to scroll with the cursor -RRB- .

13512780	notion	like	3	3	1	1	I like the notion of getting input from other editors during the act of creation ; but Nlu wants to get rid of articles without even knowing what they will look like .

13512852	idea	like	4	4	1	1	I like the other idea above too .

74114351	culture	like	41	41	39	39	This is not really about whether Avatar is American or not , if sources are there saying it is I ' m happy for them to go in and for Avatar to be American , but I do not like the culture of editors setting the criteria for a film ' s nationality and the fact that they do not think references are required for such a claim .

74129214	grass	like	60	60	45	45	This list , Books for four-year-old children seems to be from the US but includes The House at Pooh Corner , if your four year old deserves to be imbued with Englishness at an early age ; `` Being enchanted , its floor was not like the floor of the Forest , gorse and bracken and heather , but close-set grass , quiet and smooth and green .
74135471	term	like	17	17	15	15	This list is pure fancruft -LRB- yes , I know some people here do not like the term but this is the epitome of it -RRB- and is of no encyclopedic value whatsoever - I doubt categorizing Simpsons episodes by theme serves any encyclopedic purpose .

74226785	idea	likes	46	46	44	44	This is partly because the jaded cynic in me fears that mandatory registration could be more effective at getting our vandals to create vandalism only accounts than at getting our IP editors to create accounts ; and partly because the lazy side of me likes the idea of only one patroller flagging an edit as good or bad instead of everyone who has Beaver on their watchlist having to check the good IP edits because even after 6 hours you might have been the first to check that edit .
74230487	anime	like	33	33	32	32	This is precisely the type of bias I was pointing out all morning in the AfD , the sort of false belief that noone but 15 year old pimply geeks could possibly like anime , or that an anime such as Gundam could have an impact on the pop , and regular for that matter , culture of Japan .

74306063	content	like	10	10	8	8	This is borderline for me , because I like user-created content that is encyclopedic , but I vote Delist if only for the reason that it strikes me in some way as original research and self-referencing .
