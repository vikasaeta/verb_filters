17924511	B	preferring	7	7	4	4	I echo Zad68 in preferring C , B , and A last , but agreeing to abide by whichever approach will resolve the dispute .

18013670	notability	prefer	13	13	4	4	I ' d also prefer the term `` notes '' instead of `` notability '' for each table - `` notability '' sounds a little too Wikipedia-orientated .

18114929	article	prefer	43	43	36	36	I actually do think a reasonable reader , rather than having several small articles to look through , all of them assuming that the reader already knew how one article relates to the other , would prefer a single , reasonably long coherent article that answers most questions in one place .

43376768	focus	prefer	3	3	1	1	I prefer sloppy focus under X11 , but any kind of FFM is a mixed blessing under Aqua , since the global menu bar also reflects the application that has the focus -LRB- and , I think , it auto-raises windows -RRB- .

43376936	composition	prefer	3	3	1	1	I prefer the composition of the original .
43376937	composition	prefer	3	3	1	1	I prefer the composition on the first , mainly because the second one seems to end too abruptly with those tanks and seemingly a small bit of the coast cutoff at the right - not a real big issue re EV , but it just looks too tight visually ; it also affects the look of background , with that hill that looks far better in the first version where it runs down to the sea .

43376978	example	prefer	3	3	1	1	I prefer the example of the Roman Catholic Church article , but I think it would be almost impossible to achieve for Mormonism .
43376979	image	prefer	5	5	1	1	I prefer the existing FP image which also shows a corner of Saturn in the background , and which incidentally the user has not only replaced as the main picture in the article , but removed from the Dione article completely .

43376993	one	prefer	4	4	1	1	I prefer the first one because even though the second gives more magnification for the compound eyes , the first has slightly better composition .

43376999	option	prefer	4	4	1	1	I prefer the first option as more workable .
43377000	option	prefer	4	4	1	1	I prefer the first option , because in due course it would be appropriate to have articles on all the regional cuisines , so any merge would be followed in due course by a de-merge .

44638816	title	prefer	23	23	4	4	I think I would prefer if it were made clear that we are translating -LRB- or attempting to translate -RRB- the name and title , rather than providing an alternate or previous name -LRB- which is the way I read it at first .

44642126	piece	prefer	9	9	5	5	I think most companies would prefer a low-profile puff piece to a high-profile featured article -RRB- , but there ' s a sucker born every minute , and among the myriad ways in which fools are parted from their money , one could do worse than to fund an FA .

44659379	transwiki	prefer	14	14	10	10	I think the only area we disagree is that I prefer testing merging and transwiki before deletion ; if this can be transwikied to a Wikia , then all the better .

44686669	emphasis	prefer	5	5	3	3	I would personally prefer an emphasis on helping rogue editors learn how to contribute positively instead of just blocking the IPs used , but I would opt for a standard 3 month review of all range blocks , so that unneeded ones did not accumulate .
44686670	reference	prefer	5	5	3	3	I would personally prefer a reference directly after the sentence .
44686671	link	prefer	18	18	3	3	I would personally prefer a stub that includes the link as further reading rather than just a straight link to an external website .
